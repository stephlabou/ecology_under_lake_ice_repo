To use the scripts here, please download the publicly available dataset from the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity, DOI: 10.5063/F12V2D1V. 
This is the "base" data that will be used in all subsequent data reformatting, analysis, and figure generation.

Please carefully read the metadata of the publicly available dataset for information about how the data were collected and data use caveats and restrictions. 
We are making these scripts available to complement the public data and be transparent about when and how data were filtered and subsetted prior to analyses. 
We hope this will help future users of the public data make informed decisions about re-use of the dataset.

Please note that results output using the publicly available dataset will be different than those in Hampton et al. 2016 due to the absence of certain lakes in the publicly available dataset.
